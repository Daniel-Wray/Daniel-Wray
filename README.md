Here I will be posting any code and programs I've written. I am new to Github so I apologize in advance for any mistakes in how I've implemented this page.

For specific things you can expect from me:
- Data Analysis, including data cleaning, simple statistics, regression
- Simulations, typically of the Monte Carlo variety.
- Other algorithms

I am able to program in R and Python, and I am interested in learning Java.
On a less professional side (but still useful!), you will find my various self-created codes in relation to videogames.
For example, you can find Monte Carlo simulations on gacha systems, or a Wordle solver.

I am also in the process of learning machine learning. I think machine learning is very cool and that it will also be useful for sifting through the endless sea of data and images on the internet.

I hope you enjoy my page! :)
